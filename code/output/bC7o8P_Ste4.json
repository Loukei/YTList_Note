Many tech companies want people to solve coding challenges during interviews and many of the challenges can be solved using a greedy algorithm. A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage.\n\n✏️ Course from Tanishq Chaudhary.
