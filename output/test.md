## Description

Learn how to use greedy algorithms to solve coding challenges. Many tech companies want people to solve coding challenges during interviews and many of the challenges can be solved using a greedy algorithm. A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage.
